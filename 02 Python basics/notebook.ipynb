    "\n",
    "Python has only one built-in conditional statement and it is the `if` -` elif` - `else` statement. We will not find here the `case` -` switch` construct known from other programming languages. Here is the simplest form of this instruction:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "number_1 = 5\n",
    "number_2 = 2\n",
    "if number_1 > number_2:\n",
    "    print('First number is bigger than the 2nd.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how its more extensive version looks like, with support for data entered from the keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "number = input('Give me a number: ')\n",
    "number = int(number)\n",
    "\n",
    "if number < 10:\n",
    "    print('This is a rather small number')\n",
    "elif 9 < number < 100:  # shorthand for ranges\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    print('This has to be a really big number')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To build more complex conditions we use Boolean operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if number < 10 or number > 15:\n",
    "    print('The number is in the wrong range.')\n",
